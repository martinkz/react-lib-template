# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest/RTS<br>Library example

This template provides a minimal setup to get a React component library working in Vite with HMR and ESLint. Includes testing with Vitest and React Testing Library.

It contains a Counter component. If you're looking to use this template as a base for something else, the component name is defined and used in the following files:

- package.json
- vite.config.js
- App.tsx
- src/Counter.tsx
- src/index.ts
- src/test/counter.test.tsx

To preview the production build, comment out the lib/rollup build settings in vite.config.ts before building the project.
